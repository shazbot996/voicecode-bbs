## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+**
- **Linux** with ALSA (for TTS playback via `aplay`)
- A working **microphone**
- [**Claude CLI**](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-cli) and/or [**Gemini CLI**](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) installed and authenticated

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shazbot996/voicecode-bbs.git
cd voicecode-bbs

# Automated setup (checks system deps, creates venv, installs everything)
make init

# Or manually:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

System dependencies (installed via your package manager):
- `libportaudio2` — audio capture
- `alsa-utils` — TTS playback (`aplay`)

### Run

```bash
make voicecode

# Or manually:
source venv/bin/activate
python voicecode_bbs.py
```

### Run from a parent repo

This application is designed to live inside a deployment or monorepo alongside your project code. The `make init-sub` command installs a `voicecode` target into the parent folder's Makefile so you can launch from the repo root:

```bash
make init-sub   # one-time setup — adds target to ../Makefile
make voicecode   # run from repo root
```

### Folder Layout

VoiceCode expects a single **working folder** — typically the root of your repo. Within that folder it looks for:

- `prompts/` — your prompt library (templates, reference prompts)
- `docs/` — markdown documents browsable via the shortcuts overlay

Point the **Working Directory** setting (in the **O** settings menu) at your repo root and VoiceCode will pick up both subfolders automatically. Prompt history is saved separately under `{prompt_library}/voicecode/history/`.

All paths are configurable via the in-app settings menu (**O** key).

---

## What Is This?

VoiceCode is a voice-first prompt and context refinery for working with AI agents. It's a terminal UI wrapper for Claude CLI and Gemini CLI, intended to feed prompts more smoothly from your brain, and curate a local development environment's markdown context to better ground agent execution. The difference between vibe coding and surgical gen-ai development starts with context discipline. At the same time, there is a profound need to write as much of a developer's own precise context as possible to focus the builds and control the outcomes when you finally execute a plan. You get better outcomes with specificity. In other words, typing boatloads of long form prompts by hand, and it takes a lot of time. If you are short-cutting this, then you aren't really controlling what you are making.

So I built an voice dictation system, vibe coded with and refined until it really felt to be accelerating the process. It's an ongoing experiment in context generation for a prompt library intended to be managed within the repo it is building. Embedded in a deployment's repository, it has a built-in context publication and drift management system that I think could become a useful layer in more consistent constraint, conventions, and document drift to let your agents rely less on the built-in agent cli memory.  We still fall back on that layer, but independence of state and context control is better when you control. 

This is not a general-purpose dictation tool. It is purpose-built for the prompt engineering workflow: you dictate fragments of what you want, refine them into a structured prompt with AI assistance, then execute that prompt against an agent. Prompt histories are preserved so you can browse and re-execute previous work. The trick is the fluidity with how you can build a prompt by combining your voice dictation, hand direct editing, copy/paste integration, and an interactive "string injector" that can paste critical syntax strings from your project into your prompt with a single keystroke.

The interface is a full curses "TUI" styled after 1990s bulletin board systems with all the retro charm you remember (or wish you did). Yeah I'm an old head and I feel all warm and cozy in a curses UI. It's keyboard shortcuts and fast workflow.

## The Prompt Refinery Workflow

```
  1. DICTATE       2. REFINE        3. ITERATE       4. EXECUTE       5. PUBLISH
 ┌──────────┐   ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐
 │  Speak   │   │ AI turns │    │ Add more │    │  Prompt  │    │ Publish  │
 │  your    │──►│ fragments│───►│ fragments│───►│  sent to │───►│ docs from│
 │  ideas   │   │ into a   │    │ re-refine│    │  Claude/ │    │ your     │
 │          │   │ prompt   │    │ repeat   │    │  Gemini  │    │ prompts  │
 └──────────┘   └──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘
    [SPACE]         [R]          [SPACE] [R]        [E]              [P]
```

1. **Dictate** — Press SPACE to record. Speak naturally; fragments accumulate in the buffer. Start and stop repeatedly. Undo mistakes.
2. **Refine** — Press R to have AI synthesize your fragments into a polished prompt.
3. **Iterate** — Continue dictating additional fragments and refine again. The AI merges new dictations into the ongoing refined prompt, building on what's already there. This loop is the core of the Prompt Refinery — you can circle back through dictate and refine as many times as needed until the prompt captures exactly what you mean.
4. **Execute** — Press E to send the prompt to your agent. Watch the ZMODEM animation, then the response streams in with a typewriter effect.
5. **Publish** — Press P to turn your refined prompts into structured documentation. Publish agents take your prompt as scope and generate architecture docs, plans, specs, glossaries, and constraints files — building a living docs library from your voice-driven workflow.

**Direct Query** — Not every prompt needs refinement. In fact, many are damaged by it. Press **D** to skip the refinery entirely and send your dictation straight to the agent. The value here is still the multimodal dictation buffer — combining voice, keyboard edits, and shortcut injection gives you a better first draft than voice dictating into a text field. When your dictation comes out clean, just fire it. Mess up? Just press "U" and try the last section again. The dictation system is meant to append repeated "chunks" of vocal capture. The user will quickly learn a balance between a long monologue of text, and smaller fragment captures to assemble a layered dictation transcript. 

---

We spend far more time managing prompts than we do managing agents. The bottleneck in AI-assisted development isn't the agent — it's getting the right prompt to the agent in the first place. Voicecode gives you two paths to execute a dictatation: **Direct** for clean dictations that need no revision, and **Refine** for complex prompts that benefit from the iterative Prompt Refinery loop. Both paths converge at **Execute**. Execute sends your prompt to claude code for execution directly. **Publish** now has an increasing list of task-specific agents to create and refine specific types of context markdown in an opinionated structure - it's goal is to incorporate precise context generation for application architecture, planning and agent behavior. 

This is the philosophy behind VoiceCode's three-pane layout:

![VoiceCode BBS Screenshot](voicecode-bbs-shot.png)

- **Prompt Browser** (top-left) — View and browse your refined prompts. History entries show both the prompt and agent response in a combined scrollable view. Favorites indicators on the left border.
- **Dictation Buffer** (bottom-left) — Watch voice fragments accumulate in real-time. This is where the refinement loop lives — dictate, refine, dictate more, refine again.
- **Agent Terminal** (right) — ZMODEM transfer animation, then typewriter-streamed responses with context meter. Activity spinner shows agent status and stall warnings.
- **Publish Document Window** (modal, fullscreen) — Pressing [P] opens the publish document window that lists available document publishing agents, and lets you execute them from your existing prompt content, either direct or refined.

This model is also why VoiceCode is a retro CLI and not a web app. Everything in this application is keyboard shortcuts — the thing you lose in a modern web UI is often found in the simplicity of a command line interface. When your workflow is about fast iteration between voice and text, every millisecond of friction matters. Curses gives you that speed and simplicity.

## Features

### Audio Pipeline

```
Microphone (16kHz mono)
       │
       ▼
   30ms blocks (480 samples)
       │
       ▼
   Silero VAD ──── silence? ──── skip

       ▼
   Dictation Buffer / CLI
```

- **Silero VAD** detects speech vs. silence in real-time
- **faster-whisper** transcribes speech locally (no cloud API) with int8 quantization
- **Piper TTS** provides local text-to-speech output with multiple voice options
- Models are **lazy-loaded** on first use — startup takes ~1 second

### Prompt History & Response Archive

Every executed prompt is saved as a paired set of files — the prompt and its agent response:

```
{prompt_library}/voicecode/history/
  ├── 001_binary_search_function_prompt.md
  ├── 001_binary_search_function_response.md
  ├── 002_refactor_auth_middleware_prompt.md
  ├── 002_refactor_auth_middleware_response.md
  └── 003_add_unit_tests_prompt.md
```

When browsing history with **Left/Right** arrows, the Prompt Browser shows both the original prompt and the agent's response in a combined view with ASCII section headers. Use **Up/Down** to scroll through long entries. Press **F** to toggle between active and favorites views.

### 10-Slot Favorites

Press **F** to toggle favorites view or add the currently viewed historical prompt to a favorites slot. When viewing a historical prompt, **F** prompts you to assign it to one of 10 numbered slots (keys 1-9 and 0). Quick-load any favorite by pressing its number. Favorites indicators on the Prompt Browser border show which slots are filled.

### Session Continuity

Each session gets an ID passed to Claude via `--resume`, so conversation context carries across multiple execute cycles. Press **W** to start a fresh session. The context meter on the agent terminal border shows how much of Claude's context window has been used.

### Agent Stall Detection

While an agent is running, VoiceCode monitors output activity. If no output is received for 60+ seconds, a stall warning appears with a reminder that you can press **K** to kill the agent. A live activity spinner shows time since last output while the agent is working.

### Shortcuts Browser

Press **Tab** to open the shortcuts browser — a navigable overlay with four categories (cycle with **Left/Right**):

- **Shortcuts** — user-defined strings from `settings/shortcuts.txt`
- **Project Folders** — top-level and nested folders from your working directory
- **Documents** — root context files (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, README.md) plus markdown files from your `docs/` folder, with color-coded type badges. Select a document and press **Enter** to open the document actions overlay (view, maintenance actions) or **Ins** to inject the path into the dictation buffer. Press **Del** to delete a file (with confirmation).
- **Tools** — available tools for the active AI provider (Claude or Gemini)

This works **mid-recording**: the shortcut is timestamped and merged into the final transcript at the correct position using Whisper's word-level timestamps.

### Google Cast / Chromecast

VoiceCode can broadcast TTS summaries to Google Cast devices (Nest speakers, Chromecast, speaker groups) on your local network. Requires the `pychromecast` package to be installed.

Enable via **O** (options) → **Google Cast Notifications**:

- **Scan for Devices** — discovers Cast devices and speaker groups on your network
- **Select devices** — toggle individual devices on/off for broadcast
- **Cast Volume** — force device volume before playback (20–100%)
- **Mute Local TTS** — play speech only on Cast speakers, silencing local output

When enabled, every TTS summary is generated as a WAV file and streamed to all selected Cast devices simultaneously.


### Publish Documents

Press **P** to open the Publish overlay — a two-step modal that generates structured documentation from your codebase using specialized AI agents. The publish workflow closes the loop on the Prompt Refinery: you dictate and refine your thoughts, then publish them as living documentation that agents and teammates can reference on every session. Each publish agent reads actual code and merges your prompt scope into a well-structured markdown file.

We also enforce a standard YAML frontmatter layer for your context documents - this becomes valuable longer term as we look to build automations into the context repository.

**Step 1 — Pick a document type:**

| Type | Agent | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| **ADR** | ADR Agent | Captures a single significant technical decision — context, alternatives considered, the choice made, and consequences. Each ADR is numbered sequentially and lives in `decisions/`. |
| **ARCH** | Architecture Agent | Analyzes the codebase and produces a comprehensive architecture document — components, data flow, state management, and design decisions. The single document an unfamiliar engineer reads first. |
| **CONSTRAINTS** | Constraints Agent | Maintains `docs/context/CONSTRAINTS.md` with hard boundaries and safety rails that AI agents read every session. Describe constraints in plain language and the agent structures them. |
| **CONVENTIONS** | Conventions Agent | Maintains `docs/context/CONVENTIONS.md` with agreed-upon team practices — naming, file layout, code style, git workflow, and documentation patterns. Unlike constraints, conventions guide rather than block. |
| **GLOSSARY** | Glossary Agent | Maintains a single glossary at `docs/context/GLOSSARY.md`. Defines shared vocabulary — domain terms, acronyms, and project-specific jargon. Request a full codebase scan to auto-generate definitions, or add terms incrementally. |
| **PLAN** | Plan Agent | Produces a stepwise implementation plan with scope, milestones, task breakdown, and dependencies. References real files and functions so a developer or AI agent can follow it without guessing. |
| **README** | README Agent | Curates and maintains `README.md` at the project root. Keeps the GitHub landing page accurate with project overview, setup instructions, features, and usage. Ask for a full scan or describe specific updates. |
| **SCHEMA** | Schema Agent | Derives and maintains `docs/context/SCHEMA.md` by scanning the codebase for models, tables, data classes, and relationships. Point it at reference materials or ask for a full scan. |
| **SPEC** | Spec Agent | Generates a detailed feature specification — requirements, API contracts, edge cases, and acceptance criteria. The authoritative reference designers and reviewers check against. |

**Step 2 — Pick a destination folder** within `docs/`:

For now, I let the user generate any kind of file in any kind of folder, but we do enforce a specific folder structure under our configured working directory:

```
docs/
  context/          — what the agent reads every session
  decisions/        — ADRs, numbered sequentially
  plans/            — active and archived plans
  specs/            — feature specs
```

The publish agent uses your current prompt as its scope (what to focus on), builds a specialized system prompt for the selected document type, and sends it through the normal agent execution pipeline. The result is a well-structured markdown file written to your chosen `docs/` subfolder.

### Document Maintenance

The first steps in what could be the most valuable layer eventually! Our document browser maintaining proper YAML frontmatter lets us track these documents with predictable fields. Our first example of this is using that frontmatter to allow directed agents to know what type of context document a given file is, and apply a curated agent for that context document to serve ongoing maintenance. These context surfaces could easily ground numerous context-aware agents for development, maintenance, and interesting cross-cutting enforcement layers. For now, we are mostly fighting drift with the current draft of the app.

Published documents can be maintained via specialized maintenance agents accessible from the document browser. Open **Tab** → **Documents**, select a document, and press **Enter** to see available actions, or open a document in the reader and press **M** for maintenance actions.

| Action | Agent | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Reconcile** | Reconcile Agent | Checks a document for drift against the current codebase and produces a drift-report. |
| **Refresh** | Refresh Agent | Rewrites a document in-place so every fact matches the live code. |
| **Coverage** | Coverage Agent | Scans for gaps between a document and the codebase, producing a coverage-report. Available for ARCH, GLOSSARY, SCHEMA, CONSTRAINTS, and CONVENTIONS docs. |
| **Drift Check** | CTX_DRIFT Agent | Finds stale sections in root context files (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md). |
| **Update** | CTX_UPDATE Agent | Regenerates a root context file from the current codebase. |

Drift-reports and coverage-reports appear as child documents nested under their parent in the browser and are view-only.

### Configuration

Settings are persisted to `settings/settings.json` (project-local) and can be changed in-app via the **O** key:

- **Paths** — Prompt library, working directory, documents directory
- **Voice** — Whisper model size, VAD sensitivity, silence timeout, min speech duration
- **TTS** — Enable/disable, volume gain, voice selection, voice downloads
- **AI** — Provider selection (Claude/Gemini), Gemini CLI command override
- **Cast** — Enable, volume, device selection, mute local TTS
- **Test Tools** — Echo test, TTS test sound, Cast broadcast test
